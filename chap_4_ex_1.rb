=begin
Create a superclass called Vehicle for your MyCar class to inherit from and move the behavior
that isn't specific to the MyCar class to the superclass.
Create a constant in your MyCar class that stores information about the vehicle that makes
it different from other types of Vehicles.

Then create a new class called MyTruck that inherits from your superclass that also has a
constant defined that separates it from the MyCar class in some way.
